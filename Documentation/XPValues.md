We followed these XP core values throughout the duration of the project

**Communication** </br>
Short weekly scrum calls enabled us to keep each other in loop with the status of each of our tasks. In addition to regular scrums, we were made sure any urgent queries were immediately resolved over quick texts or phone calls. 

**Simplicity** </br>
At times, we found ourselves going overboard with requirements. We thought it would be cool to use Amazon S3 to store images of different vehicles. However, we realized such images may be copyrighted and decided to embrace the principle of simplicity and scrapped the idea.

**Feedback** </br>
Our weekly scrum calls were very constructive with reinforced feedback from each other as API backend models were tied to each other closely. Feedback mechanism was an important part of ensuring continuous integration without breaking the regression.
